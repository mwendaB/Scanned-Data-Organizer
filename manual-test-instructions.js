🧪 MANUAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

The Scanned Data Organizer app is now running with fixed analytics!

📍 Open: http://localhost:3000

🔧 Test Steps:

1. SIGN UP / SIGN IN:
   - Try signing up with any email (like test@example.com)
   - Or sign in if you already have an account

2. ONCE LOGGED IN, CHECK ALL DASHBOARD TABS:
   
   📊 Analytics Tab:
   - Should show documents per day chart
   - Should show documents by category
   - Should show processing time trends
   - Should show user activity
   - Should show tag usage
   - Should show weekly stats
   - NO MORE "Demo Mode" indicator

   ⚠️  Risk Management Tab:
   - Should show risk assessments
   - Should show compliance status
   - Should show audit findings

   📋 Workflow Tab:
   - Should show workflow items
   - Should show document review status

   ✅ Compliance Tab:
   - Should show compliance frameworks
   - Should show audit trails
   - Should show review status

3. TEST FEATURES:
   - Upload a document to see live data update
   - Check that all tabs show real data from the database
   - Verify no "Demo Mode" labels appear

🎯 EXPECTED RESULTS:
- All dashboard tabs should fetch and display live data from Supabase
- Analytics should show real charts and numbers based on our seed data
- No fallback to sample/demo data should occur
- User activity should track real user actions

⚠️  KNOWN DATA MAPPING:
- Our seed data uses 'test-user-123' as the user ID
- When you sign up, you'll get a different user ID
- For full testing, you can upload documents to see your own data
- Or we can modify the test data to match your real user ID

🚀 All analytics fixes have been applied!
